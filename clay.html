Clay and Pottery classes will be conducted by Mr. Satish Joshi. He has been conducting Clay club for Shishuvan secondary students for the last three years.
Through these sessions, students will get an idea of techniques of clay molding, making handmade clay articles.</p>

<p style="font-family: arial black;":>Advantages of Clay workshop:</p>
<p>Beneficial for developing motor skills: Children pound, pinch, flatten, tear, poke, squeeze, coil, roll and bend their clay into all sorts of shapes and sizes. This is an excellent way to improve dexterity and strengthen large and fine motor skills
Clay is Therapeutic: Clay is a wonderful tactile medium that can be very calming for both children and adults. Manipulating the clay can be an outlet for children to convey their emotions and reduce stress.
Self-esteem: Clay is quick to mold and children feel they are in charge of the medium. This feeling gives them the confidence to communicate their vision. Once children learn to express their personal visions in clay, they can be empowered in ways that go far beyond the art room.
Creative problem solving: Playing with clay stimulates children's imaginations. Children playing with clay can experiment with building techniques and adapt to change along the way. This type of learning promotes problem-solving skills.</p>
