<p>Cooking can give children and teens a great sense of satisfaction and build their self-confidence. 
When children cook, they are learning many skills, including math and reading skills as well as how to
 work together. They also get a chance to practice motor skills and concentration through things like pouring,
 stirring, and measuring. Cooking is a great sensory experience that children enjoy. When they prepare by having 
 the basic supplies on hand and selecting some simple recipes, we are setting the stage for learning and fun through 
 cooking. Cooking activities are messy too! Children can pick up on our tension if we are worried about messes. Then 
 they could become nervous and afraid of making more messes and mistakes. If we are relaxed about messes and mistakes,
 the children will be too. If we teach a positive attitude towards trying to things and making mistakes, we are doing much 
 more than just teaching cooking. So we keep dustbin, plenty of rags handy and a smile on our faces!</p>
